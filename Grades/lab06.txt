experiment 1: question 1 : incorrect big O

Feedback
timeAppendToVectorOfSize starts with a full vector. the call to push_back causes the vector to resize and copy n items. So the push_back operation is O(n)
timeAppendToVectorOfSize is not consistent with timeRepeatedAppendUntilVectorIsSize since the vector does not resize every call. So the push_back operation in this case is O(1)
appending to a list and vector are both O(1). but a vector occasionally has to resize. so it's O(1) is amortized.
